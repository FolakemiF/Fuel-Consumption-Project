# Fuel Consumption Project
Fuel consumption has implications to climate change and the general environment hence the 
need for accurate prediction and classification of motor vehicles. 

# Dataset
The dataset can be obtained 
from: https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-
6f16bf24dd64/resource/80894b62-7b45-4150-946d-ab756814c4be 

# Objective
The task is to predict the CO2 emission of the vehicles, classify the vehicles based on the 
categorical variables and  form group to determine which categorical variable best describes the groups 
formed. 

# Methodology
Linear regression is the method used to predict CO2 emissions. 

K-fold cross validation was initially used to classify the dataset in order to find the most effective model. The model was created using a decision tree since it performed the best.

Kmeans Clustering was used to form groups
