# Fuel-Consumption-Project

Overview 
Fuel consumption has implications to climate change and the general environment hence the 
need for accurate prediction and classification of motor vehicles. 

# Dataset
The dataset can be obtained 
from: https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-
6f16bf24dd64/resource/80894b62-7b45-4150-946d-ab756814c4be 

# Objective
The task is to predict the CO2 emission of the vehicles, classify the vehicles based on the 
categorical variables and  form group to determine which categorical variable best describes the groups 
formed.
